I've been a geek all my life and have been using Linux a long time. I've done a lot of experiments in that time. I am a co-founder, Lead designer and Lead programmer of the future Lucid OS distribution.

### My Vision.

My goal is to create a operating system that people can use within all stages of learning. Those stages include beginner, Intermediate and Advanced learning. The operating system will be able to be completely built in a source environment or be capable of running entirely within a binary environment.

### What I've worked on so far.
